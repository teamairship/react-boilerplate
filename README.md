# Airship React Web Application Starter Kit

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Usage

This repository is intended to be a living codebase that will allow the [Airship](https://teamairship.com) team to get up and running quickly on new React web projects. The intention is to have a unified folder structure across projects, however, what is provided is not set in store. Feel free to open Issues to discuss changes as the team evolves over time.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
